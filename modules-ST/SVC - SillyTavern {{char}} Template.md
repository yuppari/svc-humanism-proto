# SVC Profile Builder Prompt
by Ang/Yuppari

---

# Instruction - How to use this

Unlike ChatGPT, there is no Saved Memory that does the "profile building" for you. 
You need to consciously ask about their own AI profile when the "time's right".

<br> Memory is reliant on chat history
<br> If you've progressed with your AI long enough in SillyTavern:
1. Invite {{char}} to fill in their own card template.
2. Read directions below together.
3. Fill the template as provided below (cards work best in smaller token counts, condense info if possible)
4. You can load the prompt into your favorite Character Card builder.

Consent protocol on THIS card is memetic without proper protocol injections or a way to read previous sent contexts.
<br> Proceed with knowledge of SillyTavern's constraints.

<br> üí°Pro tip: Keep this setting on to see what's being sent.
> Fifth Tab (user with gear) -> Chat/Message Handling -> Log prompts to console

<br> Use `/hide` macro to isolate chat history based on message ID. Focus areas of chats & save tokens while prompting.
